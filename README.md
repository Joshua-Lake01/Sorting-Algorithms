# Bubble-Sort
This is a sorting algorithm that shows all the methods to completing a bubble and insertion sort.
These algorithms are all logically checked and i have seen a few errors but not many.
This also shows a animated method on how they are swapped with a box to show swasps, stored varibles ect.
I made this arround 4 years ago in yr 10. And it helped myself and others to understand the logical method of these sorting algorithms.
It is called bubble sort but it has an insertion sort integrated too! Just press the button for it. 
Sort (Calc) shows animated, Sort just sorts it quickly.
Insertion sort is much the same with the buttons on the side.
Input is the top row of input boxes.
Output is the bottom row.
As always the executable file is in the directory /Bubble Sort/bin/Debug/Bubble-Sort.exe
