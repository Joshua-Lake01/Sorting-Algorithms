# Bubble-Sort
This is a sorting algorithm that shows all the methods to completing a bubble and insertion sort.
These algorithms are all logically checked and i have seen a few errors but not many.
This also shows a animated method on how they are swapped with a box to show swasps, stored varibles ect.
I made this arround 4 years ago in yr 10. And it helped myself and others to understand the logical method of these sorting algorithms.
